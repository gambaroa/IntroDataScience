# THE MIND; *collaboration game* 
Can community groups succeed in non-verbal coordination tasks better than isolated (non-community) groups? 


## Goal of the experiment 
The **goal**  is to see whether the community groups do overall better in a non-verbal coordination task. In a community group, people will be more cooperative and adjust their behavior than in isolated groups


## Measurement 

* the overall time it takes the group to move to the next round (time to success per round), 
*	the overall time it takes the group to succeed the task (overall time to success)
*	how many tries it took to succeed a round (nb of success/nb of trials) (success rate per round), 
*	how many tries it took to succeed the task (nb of success/nb of trials overall) (overall success rate) 
*	the number of times participant “connect” (except the 1st mandatory) during the round (number of connect)
*	the number of times participant “connect” overall across the game (overall number of connect)

## Variables 
* **ID (1/2/3)**: identity of the person that is playing 
* **T (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: trial (coded as 1 or 0 which means if they did trial or not)
* **C (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: number of connects 
* **D (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: duration of the trial
* **G (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: gini coefficient; how much the trial was difficult
* **TT**: total trial in a round 
* **DT**: total duration of the round 
* **RATE**: measure success rate of the round (number of trial divided by 7)
