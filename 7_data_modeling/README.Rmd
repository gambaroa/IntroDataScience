# THE MIND; collaboration game 

![](https://image.smythstoys.com/original/mobile/8026362.jpg)

## Abstract

Can community groups succeed in non-verbal coordination tasks better than isolated (non-community) groups? 
 
For this practical i will use data that i collected for a project group

The aim of this study is to test whether community groups succeed better in non-verbal coordination tasks than isolated groups. To date,literature suggests that interaction sets precedent for conventions in a group. Thus, we predicted that for this type of coordination game The Mind, more repeated interactions between people will lead to a better performance, because of shared conventions. In other words, the community condition should perform better. However, our predictions were not supported in the results, as there were no significant difference among conditions.


## Method

**Instruction of the game:**
Subjects are going to play a card game (The Mind) in groups of 3. This game is played in up to 12 rounds, of increasing difficulty. The aim is to put cards from 1-100 in increasing order (each participant having from 1 to 12 cards according to the round) without communicating during this process. Every time the increasing order is not respected, the players lose a life. For our purpose, when the order is not respected At the beginning of a round (or whenever a player summons it) all the players reach their hands in the middle of the table to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù. For our purposes, the subjects will be separated in 2 conditions and play 5-7 rounds. 

*	**Community condition**: a group of three that don‚Äôt have prior relationships play the 5-7 rounds together. 
*	**Isolated group condition**: three participants that don‚Äôt have prior relationships will play a round together. before moving to the next round 2 players (also strangers) are changed. This manipulation is done until we arrive at 5-7 rounds, making sure that we never have in the group subjects that have already played together.


**Sample**: Between-subjects design

***N***= 30

**Structure**

* Group of 3 subjects
* Conditions:
  + Community groups:    3 subjects play 5 rounds together (N= 15)
  + Isolated groups:     15 subjects play 5 rounds with different partners in each round (N=15)





## Data set 
```{r DATA, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
DATA <- read_excel("~/Desktop/DATA SCIENCE/DATA.xlsx")
View(DATA)
kable(head(DATA))
```

## Description of the measurements 

This is how we collected the data

* **TIME TO SUCCESS PER ROUND:** the overall time it takes the group to move to the next round 
*	**PVERALL TIME TO SUCCESS:** the overall time it takes the group to succeed the task 
*	**SUCCESS RATE PER ROUND:** how many tries it took to succeed a round (nb of success/nb of trials)
*	**OVERALL SUCCESS RATE:** how many tries it took to succeed the task (nb of success/nb of trials overall)
*	**NUMBER OF CONNECT:** the number of times participant ‚Äúconnect‚Äù (except the 1st mandatory) during the round 
* **OVERALL NUMBER OF CONNECT:** overall number of connect	the number of times participant ‚Äúconnect‚Äù overall across the game 


## Description of the variables 

* **ID (1/2/3)**: identity of the person that is playing 
* **T (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: trial (coded as 1 or 0 which means if they did trial or not)
* **C (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: number of connects 
* **D (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: duration of the trial
* **G (1/2/3/4/5/6)**: gini coefficient; how much the trial was difficult
* **TT**: total trial in a round 
* **DT**: total duration of the round 
* **RATE**: measure success rate of the round (number of trial divided by 7)

## HYPOTHESIS 1

*Community groups take overall less time to succeed the task than isolated groups*

We expect that community groups take overall less time to succeed the task than isolated groups, less time means that unsuccessful.

### Plot

So let's visualize  the total duration in each round  of the two condition.


```{r plot, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
community <- subset(DATA, CONDITION == "C")
isolated <- subset(DATA, CONDITION=="I")
conditions<-as.factor(DATA$CONDITION) 
roundfac<-as.factor(DATA$ROUND) 
  
  
ggplot(data = DATA, mapping = aes(x = roundfac, y = DT, fill= conditions  
    ))   + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato") + 
  labs(title="Plot Total Duration/Rounds", 
          x ="Rounds", y = "Total Duration") 
```

From the blox plot we can see that the *community groups* (C) take overall less time to succeed the task than *isolated groups* (I). On the y-axis we have the total duration of each round (which is the sum of time spent in the trials). On the x-axis we have the corresponding round. Visually, it seems that community group (in red) took less time to succeed a round compared to the isolated group (in blue). 

### Statistical analysis 

To be sure that there is significant differences betweent the groups, first  I checked the distribution, to see if i can use the t-test, since this is not the case i will use a non-parametric test. 

```{r stat, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}

shapiro.test(community$DT) #not normally distributed
shapiro.test(isolated$DT)#normally distributed (p-value 0.001)

resDT <-wilcox.test(DT ~ CONDITION, DATA,
                    exact = FALSE,
                    conf.int = TRUE)
resDT$p.value #0.1902361 there is no significant difference 
```

#### Conclusion

However,  in this case, the test  indicates no significant difference between conditions since the p-value is 0.19. Our possible explanation is that probably is due to the fact that size of the sample is not enought big to detect any significant differences. 




## HYPOTHESIS 2 

*Community groups have a better overall success rate than isolated groups*

The community groups have a better overall success rate than isolated groups, the rate  is obtained by dividing the number of trials succeed in a round by 7 (so the lower it is, the better) and on X axis the corresponding rounds. 


### Plot 

Let's visualize  the total rate of success in each round of the two condition.


```{r plot2, message= FALSE, warning= FALSE}
ggplot(data = DATA, mapping = aes(x = roundfac, y = RATE, fill= conditions 
))   +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = "tomato") +
  labs(title="Plot total rate/rounds",
       x ="Rounds", y = "Rate of success")

```

From the box plot you can see on y-axis the rate which is obtained by dividing the number of trials succeed in a round by 7 (so the lower it is, the better) and on X axis the corresponding rounds
Visually we can see that overall (across the rounds), the rate of *community groups* (C) (in red) is lower compared to the *isolated groups* (I) (in blue). 

### Statistical analysis 

To be sure that there is significant differences between groups, first  I checked the distribution, to see if i can use the t-test, since this is not the case i will use a non-parametric test. 


```{r stat2, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shapiro.test(community$RATE)
shapiro.test(isolated$RATE)

res <-wilcox.test(RATE ~ CONDITION, DATA,
                   exact = FALSE,
                   conf.int = TRUE)
res$p.value
```

#### Conclusion

However,  in this case, the test  indicates no significant difference between conditions since the p-value is 0.19. 


## General conclusion 

From the statistical results, the p-value indicate that we could not efficiently reject the Null Hypothesis üò¶üò¶. 
The game the Mind relies on temporal cognition since people have to connect their perception of time. Probably, community groups didn‚Äôt have enough time to develop conventions or common strategies which could have differentiated them from the isolated groups which had to readapt to their partners each round. In future, we should run a power analysis, control and assign people to the conditions randomly, assure that the recordings are of quality have a larger sample and make control for other factors (setting, relationships, number of rounds, etc.)
